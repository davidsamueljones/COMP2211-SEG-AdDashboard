When utilising the database, ensure you have a file "config.properties" in the SEG directory with the following setup:

    DB_HOST = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/seg
    DB_USER = postgres
    DB_PASSWORD = 

Where DB_HOST points to your local database and DB_PASSWORD is your DB_USER's corresponding password.
